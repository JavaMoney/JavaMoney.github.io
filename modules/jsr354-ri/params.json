Hereby basically implementations of amounts, currency and roundings are provided.\r\nYou can access the RI by adding the following maven dependenceies:\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.javamoney</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>jsr-354-ri</artifactId>\r\n  <version>0.7-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNevertheless we highly recommend you to depend on the Javamoney OSS library to be used, due to the following reasons:\r\n* the RI only contains a very small, minimalistic subset of features. \r\n* The JavaMoney project contains additional functionalities, such as \r\n** currency conversion, \r\n** currency management and \r\n** rounding and formatting faatures, \r\n** regions and validite4s support\r\n** bundles for different runtime environments\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\ntbd.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\ntbd","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
